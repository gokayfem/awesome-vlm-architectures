Idefics3-8B builds upon the foundation of pre-trained unimodal models, specifically Llama 3.1 instruct as the language model and SigLIP-SO400M as the vision encoder. It adopts a self-attention architecture, where visual features are treated as tokens and concatenated with text tokens before being fed into the LLM. To enhance OCR capabilities and address the bottleneck of limited visual tokens per image, Idefics3-8B replaces the perceiver resampler used in Idefics2 with a simple pixel shuffle strategy, similar to InternVL-1.5. This strategy reduces the number of image hidden states by a factor of 4, allowing for the encoding of larger images (up to 364x364 pixels) into 169 visual tokens. The model utilizes an image-splitting strategy during both training and inference, dividing the original image into a matrix of 364x364 pixel tiles. To preserve the 2D structure and positional information of these tiles, a text token '\n' is inserted after each row of tiles, and the downscaled original image is appended to the sequence. Additionally, each tile is prepended with textual tokens indicating its position in the matrix. The training process consists of three stages of pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. In the first pre-training stage, the backbones (LLM and vision encoder) are frozen, and only the newly initialized parameters are trained. The maximum image resolution is gradually increased from 364² to 1820². From the second stage onward, the backbones are efficiently trained using DoRA (a variant of LoRA), and larger images are introduced into the training data. The final pre-training stage focuses on training with large synthetic datasets, including Docmatix, Websight, LNQA, PixelProse, and ChartGemma. During supervised fine-tuning, NEFTune noise is applied to the inputs, and the loss is calculated only on the answer tokens. The learning rate is kept constant for the first two pre-training stages and linearly decayed to zero during the final pre-training stage and supervised fine-tuning. Idefics3-8B demonstrates significant improvements over Idefics2, particularly in document understanding tasks, achieving a 13.7-point improvement on DocVQA. This highlights the effectiveness of the Docmatix dataset and the architectural choices made in Idefics3-8B. The model also achieves state-of-the-art performance within its size category across various multimodal benchmarks, including MMMU, MathVista, MMStar, and TextVQA, showcasing its strong capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning.

**KOSMOS-2**: Built upon the foundational architecture of KOSMOS-1, it retains the Transformer-based causal language model architecture and training objectives, while introducing a significant innovation by incorporating grounded image-text pairs into its training regimen. This addition seeks to bridge the gap between visual and textual information, enabling a more cohesive understanding of multimodal content. The model differentiates itself by training on a web-scale dataset of grounded image-text pairs, known as GRIT, which includes continuous coordinates of bounding boxes translated into discrete location tokens. These tokens are intricately linked with text spans, creating a unified input representation that seamlessly integrates visual and textual elements. The training of KOSMOS-2 is extensive and multifaceted, utilizing grounded image-text pairs, monomodal text corpora, image-caption pairs, and interleaved image-text data to foster a robust learning environment. The model's training leverages a large batch size and employs the AdamW optimizer, running on 256 V100 GPUs. This process is augmented by instruction tuning with both vision-language and language-only instruction datasets, aiming to refine the model's understanding and processing capabilities across different modalities. The grounding technique is a pivotal aspect of KOSMOS-2, where **continuous coordinates of bounding boxes** are converted into **discrete location tokens**. These tokens are then linked with corresponding text spans, anchoring the textual output to specific visual inputs, enhancing the model's ability to refer to and describe particular image regions or objects with precision. KOSMOS-2's alignment techniques and fusion methods play a critical role in its ability to understand and refer to specific parts of an image directly, employing a unified input representation that combines image embeddings with grounded text and location tokens. This approach not only improves the model's referential accuracy but also its overall multimodal comprehension. The model is trained using a variety of datasets, including the specially created GRIT dataset for grounding capabilities, along with monomodal text corpora, image-caption pairs, and interleaved image-text data to bolster its language understanding, multimodal perception, and in-context learning abilities. Through these innovations, KOSMOS-2 represents a significant advancement in grounding multimodal large language models, offering enhanced capabilities in linking textual and visual information cohesively.

### **ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models**

ConvLLaVA addresses the limitations of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in high-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by replacing them with a hierarchical backbone, ConvNeXt, as the visual encoder. This architectural shift aims to reduce the computational burden caused by excessive visual tokens and quadratic complexity often associated with ViTs, especially when dealing with high-resolution images.

ConvLLaVA leverages the inherent information compression capabilities of ConvNeXt, a hierarchical convolutional neural network. ConvLLaVA, unlike traditional LMMs that rely on ViTs, employs a **five-stage ConvNeXt architecture** as its visual encoder. This encoder progressively compresses visual information across its stages, significantly reducing the number of visual tokens generated compared to ViT. The architecture mirrors other popular general LMMs like LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and VILA, consisting of a vision encoder (ConvNeXt), a large language model (LLM - Vicuna in this case), and a vision-language projector (a two-layer MLP). The ConvNeXt encoder processes the input image and generates latent visual embeddings. These embeddings are then projected into the embedding space of the LLM by the vision-language projector. Finally, the projected visual embeddings are concatenated with the text embeddings generated by the LLM's tokenizer, and this combined input is fed into the LLM. The entire model is trained using a language modeling loss. To further enhance ConvLLaVA's performance, the authors introduce two key optimizations: firstly, they update the pretrained ConvNeXt weights instead of freezing them, allowing the model to adapt to high-resolution inputs and improve the quality of visual representations. Secondly, they introduce an additional ConvNeXt stage, effectively creating a five-stage architecture (ConvNeXt†) that further compresses visual information, enabling the model to handle even higher resolutions (up to 1536x1536) while generating a manageable number of visual tokens (576). This hierarchical compression approach, combined with the linear spatial complexity of ConvNeXt, significantly reduces the computational burden on the LLM compared to ViT-based models, making ConvLLaVA a more efficient and scalable solution for high-resolution multimodal tasks.

### **Parrot: Multilingual Visual Instruction Tuning**

Parrot tackles the issue of "multilingual erosion" in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where models trained primarily on English-centric data struggle to understand and respond in other languages. It achieves this by using textual guidance to align visual tokens with language-specific embeddings, effectively enhancing the model's multilingual capabilities.

Parrot builds upon the LLaVA framework, utilizing a pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 as the vision encoder and Qwen1.5-Chat as the LLM. The architecture consists of three main components: a vision encoder, a large language model (LLM), and a multilingual **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** module. The vision encoder processes the input image and generates visual features, which are then projected into the embedding space of the LLM using a learned projector. To address the multilingual challenge, Parrot introduces a novel textual guidance mechanism. It first calculates cross-attention between the class token of the visual features and the text embeddings derived from the input prompt. This cross-attention output is then fed into the MoE module's router, which predicts the probability of activating each language expert. Each expert is a specialized MLP trained to transform the English-biased visual embeddings into language-specific representations. The router selects the most relevant experts based on the input language, and their outputs are combined to generate the final language-specific visual embeddings. These embeddings are then combined with the original visual embeddings using a weighted sum, ensuring that the model retains its ability to process visual information effectively across different languages. This entire process allows Parrot to align visual tokens with textual embeddings at the language level, effectively mitigating multilingual erosion and enhancing the model's ability to understand and respond in multiple languages.

### **OMG-LLaVA: Bridging Image-level, Object-level, Pixel-level Reasoning and Understanding**

OMG-LLaVA presents a novel framework that unifies image-level, object-level, and pixel-level reasoning and understanding within a single Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). It leverages the power of a frozen universal segmentation model (OMG-Seg) for visual encoding and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text understanding and response generation, enabling a wide range of multimodal tasks within a single, elegant architecture.

OMG-LLaVA consists of two main components: a frozen universal perception module (based on OMG-Seg) and a Large Language Model (LLM). The universal perception module is responsible for encoding the input image and visual prompts into three types of visual tokens: pixel-centric, object-centric, and object-centric derived from visual prompts. The pixel-centric tokens are generated by a **ConvNeXt-L based CLIP image encoder**, capturing dense image features. The object-centric tokens are generated by the OMG decoder, which takes learnable object queries and visual prompt queries as input and attends to the image features to extract object-level information. This decoder can handle point, box, and mask prompts by applying constraints on the attention masks. To bridge the gap between the frozen perception module and the LLM, a novel "perception prior embedding" strategy is introduced. This strategy fuses the image features with the object queries from the OMG decoder using a mask score derived from the segmentation masks and confidence scores. The resulting weighted object queries are then added to the image features to generate the pixel-centric visual tokens, providing the LLM with rich object-level information. The object-centric visual tokens are directly taken from the foreground object queries of the OMG decoder. Both types of visual tokens, along with the text instruction tokens, are fed into the LLM, which is responsible for understanding the user's intent and generating the appropriate response. The LLM outputs text responses and object-centric visual tokens, which are then decoded by the frozen OMG decoder to produce segmentation masks. This unified architecture allows OMG-LLaVA to perform a wide range of tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, referring segmentation, reasoning segmentation, grounded conversation generation, and region captioning, all within a single model.

### **EVLM: An Efficient Vision-Language Model for Visual Understanding**

EVLM is an efficient multimodal language model designed to minimize computational costs while maximizing the model's ability to perceive visual signals comprehensively. It addresses the challenges of handling long sequences of visual signals, particularly in video data, by employing a cross-attention mechanism and hierarchical ViT features, achieving competitive performance in tasks like image and video captioning.

EVLM is built upon the Flamingo architecture, incorporating a visual encoder, a large language model, and a Gated Cross-Attention Layer. To enhance visual perception, EVLM utilizes the 4.4B EVA2-CLIP-E-Plus model as the visual encoder, extracting hierarchical visual features by uniformly sampling 8 feature sequences from the last 40 layers of the transformer. These features are then sequentially fed into different Gated Cross-Attention layers of the Flamingo model. Unlike Flamingo, which uses a single media token image, EVLM replaces it with a set of 16 learnable tokens, aiming to capture visual features similar to Q-former. The attention mechanism is designed to allow each set of learnable tokens to interact only with the corresponding image, while text sequences interact only with the previous image in the multimodal sequence. This approach ensures efficient interaction between visual and textual information. For the language model, EVLM employs the Qwen-14B-Chat 1.0, chosen for its strong performance in content understanding and logical reasoning. A gated cross-attention layer is inserted before every transformer layer of the language model to condition it on visual inputs. To further enhance model effectiveness and scale trainable parameters, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism is applied to the Cross Attention layer. This involves replicating and segmenting the FFN of the base model into multiple fine-grained experts, with a routing layer selecting the appropriate set of experts for each token. The model undergoes a three-stage training process: multi-modal pre-training, multi-task continual pre-training, and multi-modal instruction fine-tuning. Pre-training focuses on cross-modal alignment and modeling intrinsic relationships within multimodal data, using a large-scale dataset of bilingual image-text captions and web-type multimodal data. Continual pre-training further enhances the model's visual question-answering ability, while instruction fine-tuning activates its instruction-following capabilities using a diverse range of high-quality instruction tuning data.

### **SlowFast-LLaVA: A Strong Training-Free Baseline for Video Large Language Models**

SlowFast-LLaVA (SF-LLaVA) is a training-free video large language model that effectively captures both detailed spatial semantics and long-range temporal context in videos without requiring any additional fine-tuning on video data. It achieves this by leveraging a two-stream SlowFast design inspired by action recognition models, allowing it to process a larger number of frames and outperform existing training-free methods on various video benchmarks.

SF-LLaVA builds upon the LLaVA-NeXT framework and utilizes a two-stream approach, similar to SlowFast networks in action recognition, to process video inputs. The model first uniformly samples N frames from the input video. These frames are then processed independently by a visual encoder, such as CLIP-L, followed by a visual-language adapter for feature alignment. The resulting frame features are then fed into two separate pathways: Slow and Fast. **The Slow pathway** focuses on capturing detailed spatial semantics by processing a smaller number of frames (Nslow) at a higher spatial resolution (e.g., 8 frames with 24x24 tokens). It applies spatial pooling with a small stride (e.g., 1x2) to aggregate features and reduce the number of tokens. **The Fast pathway** focuses on capturing temporal context and motion cues by processing all N frames (Nfast = N) at a lower spatial resolution (e.g., 64 frames with 4x4 tokens). It applies aggressive spatial pooling to each frame to prioritize temporal information. The features from both pathways are then flattened and concatenated, forming a comprehensive video representation that balances spatial details and temporal context. This aggregated feature vector, along with the text prompt and question, is then fed into the LLM (LLaVA-NeXT) to generate the final answer. This training-free approach eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning on video datasets, making SF-LLaVA highly efficient and adaptable to various video scenarios. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SF-LLaVA on three different video question-answering tasks (Open-Ended VideoQA, Multiple Choice VideoQA, and Text Generation) across eight benchmarks, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing training-free methods and even surpassing some state-of-the-art supervised fine-tuned video LLMs.

### **INF-LLaVA: High-Resolution Image Perception for Multimodal Large Language Models**

INF-LLaVA is a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed to effectively process high-resolution images. It addresses the limitations of existing cropping-based and dual-encoder methods by introducing two innovative modules: Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM) and Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM). DCM segments high-resolution images into sub-images from both local and global perspectives, preserving detailed and contextual information. DEM facilitates efficient interaction between local and global features, enhancing the model's understanding of complex visual relationships. Extensive evaluations demonstrate INF-LLaVA's superior performance on various benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in vision-language tasks.

INF-LLaVA pushes the boundaries of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by tackling the critical challenge of high-resolution image perception. It aims to leverage the richness of detail present in high-resolution images without succumbing to the computational limitations imposed by traditional MLLM architectures. INF-LLaVA achieves this through a sophisticated approach that combines innovative cropping and feature enhancement techniques, resulting in a model capable of simultaneously capturing fine-grained local details and comprehensive global context. At the core of INF-LLaVA lies the Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM), a strategic cropping strategy that surpasses conventional approaches by integrating both local and global perspectives. This dual-perspective approach ensures that each extracted sub-image retains not only the intricate details essential for accurate analysis but also the broader contextual information crucial for understanding the relationships between objects. While local-perspective cropping preserves continuous visual information at high resolution, capturing the essence of individual objects and regions, global-perspective cropping leverages a unique interleaving technique to preserve the overall spatial relationships between objects within the high-resolution image. This balanced combination ensures that the model can perceive both the "trees" and the "forest," enabling a holistic understanding of the visual scene. To further enhance the model's understanding, INF-LLaVA introduces the Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM). This module facilitates efficient and effective interaction between the local and global features extracted by the vision encoder, enriching the representation with multi-scale information. Instead of relying on computationally expensive cross-attention directly on high-resolution features, DEM employs a more resource-efficient strategy. It leverages 2D positional priors to concatenate global-perspective sub-image features back into the original image's shape, effectively recreating a high-resolution representation of the global context. These recombined features are then re-cropped from a local perspective, and cross-attention is performed between corresponding local and global sub-images to enhance global features with fine-grained local details. A symmetrical process enhances local features with global context. This meticulously designed interaction between local and global features ensures that the resulting representation is not only rich in detail but also cognizant of the broader context. The dual-enhanced features are then projected into a format compatible with the LLM through a linear connector. The LLM then processes the combined visual and textual information to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response. Through extensive evaluations on a diverse set of benchmarks, including ScienceQA-img, OKVQA, SEEDBench, MMBench, AI2D, LLaVA-Bench-in-the-wild, and MMMU, INF-LLaVA demonstrates its superior performance over existing MLLMs. Its ability to effectively handle high-resolution images while maintaining computational efficiency establishes a new state-of-the-art in the field. The open-source release of INF-LLaVA, along with its pretrained model and code, paves the way for further research and exploration of high-resolution image perception in multimodal large language models, pushing the boundaries of multimodal understanding and enabling the development of more powerful and versatile AI systems.

### **VILA²: VILA Augmented VILA**

VILA² (VILA-augmented-VILA) introduces a novel approach to address the limitations of data quantity and quality in training Visual Language Models (VLMs). Instead of relying on costly human annotation or distillation from proprietary models, VILA² leverages the VLM itself to iteratively refine and augment its pretraining data, leading to significant performance improvements and achieving state-of-the-art results on the MMMU leaderboard among open-sourced models.

VILA² employs a two-step iterative process: self-augmenting and specialist-augmenting. The self-augmenting loop focuses on enhancing the general knowledge of the VLM by using the model itself to re-caption its pretraining data. This process starts with an initial VLM (VILA0) trained on a dataset with typically short and brief captions, like COYO. VILA0 is then used to generate longer and more detailed captions for the same images, creating a synthetic dataset. This augmented dataset, combined with the original data, is used to train the next iteration of the VLM (VILA1). This loop can be repeated multiple times, with each iteration improving the caption quality and subsequently the VLM's performance. However, this self-augmentation process eventually reaches saturation. To overcome this limitation, VILA² introduces the **specialist-augmenting loo**p. This involves fine-tuning the self-augmented VLM on specific downstream tasks, creating specialist VLMs with expertise in areas like spatial awareness, OCR, and grounding. These specialists are then used to re-caption the pretraining data, focusing on their specific domain knowledge. The self-augmented VLM is then retrained on this specialist-recaptioned data, further boosting its performance. This approach leverages the synergy between the vast amount of data in pretraining and the specialized knowledge acquired during fine-tuning. The architecture of VILA² follows the standard auto-regressive VLM design, consisting of a large language model (LLM), a visual encoder, and an image-text projector. The authors experiment with different LLMs (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B-Instruct, and Yi-34B) and visual encoders (SigLIP and InternViT-6B). They also introduce a 4x downsampling of visual tokens to reduce computational cost. The training process follows the typical three-stage paradigm: projector initialization, vision-language pre-training, and visual instruction-tuning. VILA² demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, including general VQA, text-oriented VQA, general multimodal benchmarks, and image captioning. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed self- and specialist-augmentation techniques in enhancing VLM training and achieving state-of-the-art results.

MiniCPM-V focuses on achieving a balance between performance and efficiency, crucial for real-world applications on end-side devices. The model architecture consists of three key modules: a visual encoder, a compression layer, and an LLM. For the visual encoder, MiniCPM-V utilizes SigLIP SoViT-400m/14, chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness. To handle high-resolution images with varying aspect ratios, the model employs an adaptive visual encoding approach. This involves dividing the input image into slices that better match the ViT's pre-training settings in terms of resolution and aspect ratio. A score function is used to select the optimal partition of slices, ensuring a good match with the ViT's pre-training. Each slice is then resized proportionally and interpolated to fit the ViT's input size. After visual encoding, each slice is represented by 1024 tokens, resulting in a large number of tokens for multiple slices. To address this, a token compression module is employed, using one-layer cross-attention with a moderate number of queries to compress the visual tokens of each slice into 64 or 96 tokens. This significantly reduces the computational cost and memory footprint, making the model suitable for end-side deployment. A spatial schema is also introduced to indicate the position of each slice relative to the whole image, further enhancing the model's understanding of spatial relationships. The compressed visual tokens, along with the text input, are then fed into the LLM, which is based on MiniCPM 2B for earlier versions and Llama3-Instruct 8B for MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5. The training process consists of three phases: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLAIF-V (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback for Vision). Pre-training aims to align the visual modules with the LLM's input space and learn foundational multimodal knowledge. It involves three stages: warming up the compression layer, extending the input resolution of the visual encoder, and training the visual modules with the adaptive visual encoding strategy. Supervised fine-tuning further enhances the model's knowledge and interaction capabilities using high-quality visual question answering datasets. The SFT data is categorized into two parts: one focusing on basic recognition capabilities and the other on generating detailed responses and following instructions. Finally, RLAIF-V is employed to mitigate the hallucination problem common in MLLMs. This involves generating multiple responses for an instruction, evaluating their correctness using a divide-and-conquer strategy, and then optimizing the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset. MiniCPM-V demonstrates impressive performance on various benchmarks, including general multimodal benchmarks, OCR benchmarks, and multilingual multimodal interaction, while being efficient enough for deployment on mobile phones. This highlights the potential of pushing the boundaries of end-side MLLMs and bringing powerful AI capabilities to user devices.

LLaVA-OneVision inherits the minimalist design of the LLaVA series, aiming to effectively leverage pre-trained capabilities of both the LLM and the visual model while facilitating strong scaling. The architecture consists of three key components: a large language model (LLM), a vision encoder, and a projector. The authors choose Qwen-2 as the LLM due to its strong language capabilities and various model sizes available. For the vision encoder, they opt for SigLIP, which has shown to yield higher LMM performance among open vision encoders. A 2-layer MLP is used as the projector to map image features into the word embedding space, creating a sequence of visual tokens. The model utilizes a flexible visual representation strategy called Higher AnyRes, which builds upon the original AnyRes strategy introduced in LLaVA-NeXT. This strategy involves dividing the input image into crops, each with a resolution suitable for the vision encoder, and then applying bilinear interpolation to reduce the number of tokens per crop if needed. This allows the model to handle high-resolution images and videos efficiently while preserving important visual details. The specific configuration of **Higher AnyRes** is adapted for different scenarios: single-image, multi-image, and video. For single-image data, a large maximum spatial configuration is used to maintain the original image resolution and a large number of visual tokens are allocated to effectively represent the visual signal. For multi-image data, only the base image resolution is considered, eliminating the need for multi-crop and saving computational resources. For video data, each frame is resized to the base image resolution and bilinear interpolation is used to reduce the number of tokens per frame, allowing for the processing of a larger number of frames. The training process follows a three-stage curriculum learning approach: language-image alignment, high-quality knowledge learning, and visual instruction tuning. The first stage focuses on aligning visual features with the LLM's embedding space using the LLaVA align dataset. The second stage refines and enhances the model's knowledge base using high-quality data from three major categories: re-captioned detailed description data, document/OCR data, and Chinese and language data. The final stage involves visual instruction tuning, where the model is trained on a diverse set of visual tasks with preferred responses. This stage is further divided into two phases: single-image training and OneVision training. Single-image training focuses on single-image scenarios, while OneVision training expands the model's capabilities to multi-image and video scenarios, enabling task transfer and emerging capabilities. LLaVA-OneVision demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, showcasing its effectiveness and versatility in handling diverse visual scenarios.

VITA starts with the Mixtral 8x7B model as its language foundation, chosen for its strong performance and sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) architecture. To enhance its Chinese language capabilities, the vocabulary is expanded with Chinese terms, and the model undergoes bilingual instruction tuning using a high-quality bilingual text corpus. This ensures proficiency in both Chinese and English. For visual modality, VITA employs InternViT-300M-448px as the visual encoder, processing images at 448x448 resolution and generating 256 tokens after passing through a two-layer MLP visual connector. High-resolution images are handled using a dynamic patching strategy, while videos are treated as special cases of images, with frame sampling based on video length. For audio modality, a Mel Filter Bank block is used to process the input audio, followed by 4xCNN downsampling layers and a 24-layer transformer, resulting in 25 tokens for every 2 seconds of audio. A two-layer MLP serves as the audio-text modality connector. The training pipeline consists of three stages: LLM instruction tuning, multimodal alignment, and multimodal instruction tuning. LLM instruction tuning focuses on enhancing the base LLM's bilingual capabilities. Multimodal alignment aims to bridge the representation gap between text and other modalities by training individual encoders and connectors for each modality. This involves collecting and curating a large-scale, high-quality multimodal dataset, including image descriptions, general image QA, OCR and diagram data, general video descriptions, general video QA, and pure text data. Multimodal instruction tuning further refines the model's ability to follow instructions and understand different modalities. A specially designed state token is introduced to distinguish the type of input query (effective audio, noisy audio, or text), enabling non-awakening interaction during inference. To achieve natural multimodal human-computer interaction, VITA introduces two key innovations: non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt interaction. These are implemented using a duplex pipeline during deployment. Two VITA models run concurrently: one for generating responses to user queries (Generation model) and the other for monitoring environmental audio (Monitoring model). The Monitoring model uses SileroVAD for voice activity detection and filters out noisy audio based on the state token. If an effective audio query is detected, the Monitoring model interrupts the Generation model, consolidates the historical context, and responds to the latest query. The two models then swap identities, ensuring continuous monitoring and seamless interaction.VITA demonstrates strong performance on various unimodal and multimodal benchmarks, showcasing its robust foundational capabilities in multilingual, vision, and audio understanding. While still lagging behind closed-source counterparts in certain areas, VITA represents a significant step towards open-source interactive omni-modal LLMs, paving the way for future research and development in this field.
